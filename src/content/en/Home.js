      and even more so to win them.

      firstP: `The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is the first 
        international treaty negotiated under the auspices of WHO. 
        It was adopted by the World Health Assembly on 21 May 2003 and entered into force on 27 February 2005. 
        It has since become one of the most rapidly and widely embraced treaties in United Nations history.`,
      secondP: `The WHO FCTC was developed in response to the globalization of the tobacco epidemic and is an
        evidence-based treaty that reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standard of health. 
        The Convention represents a milestone for the promotion of public health and provides new 
        legal dimensions for international health cooperation.`,

          conduct in relation to the group, finding the industry liable on a number of grounds.`
