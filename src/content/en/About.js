      firstP: `Many governments, health care providers and victims of smoking-related disease have
        strong claims against the tobacco industry. But tobacco litigation has proved challenging
        in the past with claimants facing technical and legal obstacles, and legal systems being
        unable to redress the power imbalance between the industry and those it has harmed.`,
      secondP: `That said, there have been examples of litigation success in the Americas,
        Europe and Australasia. There are also innovative best practices from other legal
        fields that can be specifically adapted to tobacco litigation. This Toolkit aims
        to gather and curate this information for users, as well as to guide them towards
        implementing Article 19 in the most appropriate way for their situation.`,
    },
    quote: `Article 19 is clear that legal action to establish liability is an important part of tobacco control.
        But actions taken to address the harm caused by the tobacco industry are often without precedent and legal systems need to adapt."`

    description: `The WHO FCTC Article 19 Civil Liability Toolkit was developed by the expert group
      on liability and adopted by the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the WHO FCTC at the 7th
      Session of the COP held in Delhi, India from 7 to 12 November 2017. The expert group on
      liability was established at the 5th Session of the COP held in Seoul, Republic of Korea from

      one: '<strong>Identify, examine and collect existing best practices</strong> for civil and criminal liability including compensation.',
      two: '<strong>Identify obstacles to effective action in the areas of civil and criminal liability,</strong> (particularly civil), including compensation, and to provide potential solutions.',
      three: '<strong>Identify options for developing legislation</strong> in the areas of civil and criminal liability (particularly for civil liability).',
      four: '<strong>Provide options for technical support</strong>, international cooperation and information exchange for the effective implementation of Article 19.'
    },
    card: `The Expert Groupâ€™s mandate was continued in 2014, and in 2016,
      the establishment of this Toolkit was proposed as a practical resource to help stakeholders
