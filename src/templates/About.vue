	    			<h3>Why you need the toolkit</h3><br>
	    			<p>Many governments, health care providers and victims of smoking-related disease have strong claims against the tobacco industry. But tobacco litigation has proved challenging in the past with claimants facing technical and legal obstacles, and legal systems being unable to redress the power imbalance between the industry and those it has harmed.</p>
	    			<p>That said, there have been examples of litigation success in the Americas, Europe and Australasia. There are also innovative best practices from other legal fields that can be specifically adapted to tobacco litigation. This Toolkit aims to gather and curate this information for users, as well as to guide them towards implementing Article 19 in the most appropriate way for their situation.</p>

		    			<p>The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is an evidence-based treaty that reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standard of health. The Convention represents a milestone for the promotion of public health and provides new legal dimensions for international health cooperation, requiring Parties to adopt multi-sectoral tobacco control strategies.</p><br>
		    			<ul class="ticklist">
		    				<li>
		    					<p>Article 4 recognises, as one of the Guiding Principles, that issues relating to liability are an important part of comprehensive tobacco control.</p>
		    				</li>
		    				<li>
		    					<p>Article 19 states that Parties shall consider taking legislative action or promoting their existing laws, where necessary, to deal with criminal and civil liability, including compensation where appropriate.</p>
